This problem was asked by Spotify.

There are N couples sitting in a row of length 2 * N.
They are currently ordered randomly, but would like to rearrange themselves so that each couple's partners can sit side by side.

What is the minimum number of swaps necessary for this to happen?
 */

/*
Assume N couples are labeled from 0 to 2 * N - 1; All N couples are (0,1),(2,3),(4,5)....(2*N - 2, 2*N - 1)
the input is an array that contains all couples' labels in a random order. The goal here is to use a minimum number of
swaps to make each couple sits next to each other.
