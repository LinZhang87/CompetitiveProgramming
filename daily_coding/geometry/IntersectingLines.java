This problem was asked by Facebook.

Suppose you are given two lists of n points, one list p1, p2, ..., pn on the line y = 0 and
the other list q1, q2, ..., qn on the line y = 1.
Imagine a set of n line segments connecting each point pi to qi.
Write an algorithm to determine how many pairs of the line segments intersect.
