Let A[1..n] be an array of integers. In one step, you are allowed to add either 1 or −1 to any
element of the array. What is the minimum number of steps required to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order (A[1] ≤ A[2] ≤ · · · ≤ A[n])?

Input:
The first input line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 000), the number of elements in A.
The second input line contains integers A[1], A[2], . . . , A[n] (1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1 000).

Output:
The minimum number of steps required to make the sequence sorted.
